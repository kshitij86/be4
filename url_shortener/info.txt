URL shortener:

 - Design a URL shortner that will return a shortened URL for a given URL (uniform resource locator).
 - This is useful because it can become cumbersome to share long URLs. 

    Example - 
    "https://www.google.com/search?q=long+url&oq=long+url&aqs=chrome..69i57j0i512l6j0i131i433i512j46i512j0i512.1692j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8"
    "shorturl.at/fySY0"


 - Common services include https://bit.ly etc.

 Key features of a URL shortener - 
 - The returned URL should be shorter than the input URL.
 - No two short URLs should point to the same longURL



   "shortUrl1" ->  
                    "longURL1"
   "shortUrl2" ->

 - No two long URLs should point to the same shortURL

 
   "longUrl1" <-  
                    "shortURL1"
   "longUrl2" <-

- There should be a one to one mapping from shortURL to longURL.

How does the URL shortener work after shortening:


Client                  ->    URL shortener service gets the request   -> Target server will get the request
(User pastes the short           { "shortURL1": "longURL1"   } 
URL in the browser)              The service checks its database
                                 and redirects to the actual server
