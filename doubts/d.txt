This method is based on the fact that the maximum and minimum of 
the permutations subarray should be present for it to be a valid permutation

An example run is gievn below

A = [2, 3, 1]
arr will be created as
arr[1] = 0 {i=0}
arr[2] = 1 {i=1}
arr[0] = 2 {i=2}

so arr = [2, 0, 1]

mini = 3, maxi = 0, count = 0

next, the for loop will execute which iterates over arr
updates maxi and mini

each time check if maxi - mini = i (iteration number)
if it is, then all numbers in that range are present 
and it is a valid permutation subarray

mini = 2, maxi = 2, count = 1 {i=0} [UPDATE COUNT]
mini = 0, maxi = 2, count = 1 {i=1} [DON'T UPDATE COUNT]
mini = 0, maxi = 2, count = 2 {i=2} [UPDATE COUNT]
exit loop and return the count
